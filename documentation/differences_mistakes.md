# Differences
- Blocks only block the their individual location, no the four neighbours positions. It make more sense, it allows more block layouts, and previous behavior can be simulated by just adding more blocks.
- Mystic Horseman ability is activated during attack instead that manually during DUNGEON phase. It saves the implementation of one ability, and functionally it is equivalent to RAISEDAMAGE.
